# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis – SQL Server + Power BI

A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using **SQL Server** for data cleaning & transformation, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboard visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from 149K+ coffee shop transactions and translate them into actionable business recommendations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Coffee Shop Sales dataset by applying a full EDA process. The workflow covers importing raw CSV data into SQL Server, cleaning and preparing the dataset, creating computed columns, checking data quality, and analyzing sales performance. Finally, the cleaned dataset was visualized in Power BI to uncover business insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective

* Transform messy transactional sales data into structured, accurate information.
* Uncover patterns in sales by **time, store location, and products**.
* Understand **customer spending segments** (low, medium, high).
* Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve sales & efficiency.

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

1. Import CSV into SQL Server and define correct data types.
2. Data cleaning: fixed `Total_Bill` inconsistencies, enforced decimal precision, removed duplicates.
3. Feature engineering: created computed columns for time analysis (`Hour`, `Month`, `Day_Of_Week`).
4. Exploratory queries:

   * Monthly & hourly sales
   * Store performance
   * Top products
   * Customer spending segmentation
   * Heatmap (Hour × Day)
5. Built interactive **Power BI Dashboard**.
6. **Business Insights & Recommendations**

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Sales are **well distributed across all three store locations**, each contributing \~33% of revenue.
* **Medium spenders (\$5–\$15)** generate the majority of revenue (55%).
* **Low spenders (<\$5)** account for 38%, while **high spenders (> \$15)** only contribute 6.5%.
* Peak sales occur **8–10 AM weekdays**.
* After 7 PM, sales drop significantly across all stores.
* **Coffee** is the dominant product category, accounting for 37.5% of total revenue.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

* **Operational:** Allocate more staff during weekday morning peaks (8–10 AM), reduce staffing after 7 PM to cut costs.
* **Marketing:** Launch **seasonal promotions** (mid-year) and **afternoon happy hour campaigns** to attract more customers.
* **Customer Strategy:** Focus upselling & bundling strategies on **medium spenders (\$5–\$15)**, as they drive most revenue. Offer small promos to engage low spenders and maintain loyalty for niche high spenders.
* **Store Strategy:** Since all locations perform almost equally, prioritize **efficiency improvements across stores** (inventory, staffing, promos) rather than copying one “best performer.”
